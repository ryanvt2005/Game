# Mission Structure

## Design Goals
- Missions must be replayable with variation.
- Structure must support narrative without heavy cutscenes.
- Zones should be reused with changing conditions.
- Objectives must encourage movement and ability usage.

## Mission Flow (Standard)

1. Briefing (minimal UI + dialogue)
2. Deployment into zone
3. Primary objective(s)
4. Escalation event
5. Optional objectives
6. Boss or climax encounter
7. Resolution + rewards

## Mission Types (MVP)

### Containment
- Secure unstable zones
- Defeat or subdue rogue heroes
- Timer-based pressure

### Suppression
- Disable faction operations
- Fight coordinated hero squads
- Emphasis on positioning

### Extraction
- Escort civilians or assets
- Mixed enemy interference
- Penalize reckless ability usage

### Assault
- Direct attack on enemy stronghold
- Multiple combat arenas
- Elite enemies and mini-bosses

### Boss Hunt
- Single high-intensity encounter
- Multi-phase hero or villain boss

---

## Objective Types
- Defeat all enemies
- Disable devices
- Hold area for duration
- Escort or protect target
- Escape under pressure

Objectives are modular and combinable.

---

## Optional Objectives
- Avoid civilian casualties
- Complete within time limit
- Use environment strategically
- Minimize power instability

Optional objectives:
- Grant bonus rewards
- Influence reputation axes
- Unlock cosmetics or upgrades

---

## Failure Conditions
- Player death
- Objective timeout
- Excessive civilian damage (select missions)

Failure should:
- Teach, not punish
- Encourage tactical changes

---

## Replay Variability
- Enemy faction swaps
- Weather and lighting changes
- Modifier application
- Different hero enemies based on reputation

---

## Narrative Integration
- Dialogue triggered by:
  - Ability usage
