# Enemy Design

## Design Goals
- Enemies must reinforce the story: power is unstable and ideological.
- Hero enemies should feel like fighting another player, not a sponge.
- Reuse enemy archetypes with modifiers instead of creating many unique models.
- Support escalating difficulty without relying on inflated health pools.

## Corrupted Hero Bosses

### Core Rules
- Always use player-like abilities
- Multi-phase encounters
- Narrative dialogue during combat
- Visible loss of control over time

### Phase Structure
1. **Controlled Phase**
   - Tactical ability usage
   - Defensive reactions
2. **Unstable Phase**
   - Shorter cooldowns
   - Erratic targeting
   - Environmental damage
3. **Overload Phase**
   - High damage
   - Reduced defense
   - Emotional dialogue cues

## Enemy Modifiers (Reusable System)
Applied dynamically to increase difficulty:

- **Fractured**
  - Random ability mutations
- **Hardened**
  - Increased stagger resistance
- **Volatile**
  - Explodes or destabilizes on defeat
- **Adaptive**
  - Learns player patterns over time

---

## Difficulty Scaling Philosophy
- Do not increase health excessively
- Increase:
  - Ability frequency
  - Coordination
  - Mixed enemy compositions
  - Environmental pressure

---

## AI Behavior Principles
- Enemies react to player ability usage
- Hero enemies conserve ultimates
- Bosses punish repetitive strategies
