# Game One-Pager — Fracture: Ascension (Working Title)

## Elevator Pitch
A cinematic 3D superhero action game in the browser where the player’s chosen hero fights villains and other heroes after a global event ("The Fracture") destabilizes superhuman power.

## Player Fantasy
Be an unstoppable hero with signature abilities—then adapt as the world turns against you.

## Core Loop (MVP)
Choose hero → deploy into a city zone → complete objectives amid faction conflict → defeat a boss (villain or corrupted hero) → earn upgrades/cosmetics → repeat.

## Key Differentiators
- Heroes can be enemies for story reasons (ideology + instability).
- “Fracture” power system supports progression and boss phases.
- Replayable missions with reputation-driven encounter swaps (not full branching trees).

## Target Platform
Web application (desktop first; mobile later).

## MVP Scope (Vertical Slice)
- 1 playable zone (dense city district)
- 3 playable heroes
- 6–10 missions (Act I)
- 1 villain boss + 1 corrupted hero boss
- Basic progression + reputation tracking
