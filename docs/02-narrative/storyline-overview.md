# Storyline Overview

## Premise
A global event known as **The Fracture** destabilizes the energy source behind superhuman abilities. Powers evolve, fail, and sometimes corrupt their users.

## Why Heroes Fight Heroes
- **Instability:** heroes can become threats without choosing to.
- **Ideology:** factions disagree on control vs freedom.
- **Manipulation:** villains exploit the chaos; heroes misidentify threats.

## Factions (high-level)
- **The Vanguard:** order and regulation.
- **The Unbound:** freedom and evolution.
- **The Dominion:** villains who exploit the Fracture.

## Player Role
The player’s chosen hero becomes an **Ascendant**—someone whose powers stabilize through conflict, making them feared, hunted, and pivotal to the future.
